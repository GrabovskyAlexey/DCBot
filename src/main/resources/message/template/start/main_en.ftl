This is a helper bot for Dungeon Crusher.

It can notify you about sieges. Subscribe to the servers you care about with /subscribe.

The bot can remember your position in the maze—call /maze and mirror your path both in the game and in the bot.

It tracks maps, voids, and DH per server via /resources.

Track debts (who owes you and what you owe) for voids, maps, DH, and bottle crates with /debt.

Looking for exchange partners? Use /exchange to search for traders or buyers.

You can also configure mine notifications or shift siege alerts 5 minutes earlier with /settings.
