This is a helper bot for Dungeon Crusher—it never eats or sleeps, but it's always ready to help!

What it can do:

Notify you about sieges. Subscribe to the servers you care about with /subscribe so you never miss a siege again!

Remember your position in the maze. Just send /maze and mirror your path—even if your memory is like a goldfish's.

Track voids, maps, and other useful stuff via /resources.

Track debts: who owes you and what you owe for voids, maps, CB, and bottle crates — use /debt.

Need traders? Ping /exchange to look for an exchange offer or a buyer among other players.

It can also mute notifications for servers that are already cleared this week—use /resources to avoid extra pings.

In /settings you can enable mine notifications, shift siege alerts 5 minutes earlier (enough time to make tea), and even activate DH tracking—just in case.
